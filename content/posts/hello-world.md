Hello world, welcome to fieldnotes.tech!

Here I intend to keep my notes-to-self, code snippets, musings
and other short bits & pieces on the subject of software engineering
and tech in general.
Most of what Iâ€™ll write here will be gleaned from working in the field
and solving real issues as they arise.
Some of it will be pretty esoteric, rough, unfinished
and maybe even controversial or just plain wrong;
but all will be in the spirit of earnestly trying to be better at what I do.

With all these commitments and boring earnestness out of the way,
let's see what it becomes!
